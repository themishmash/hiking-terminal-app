<strong>4/9/19 Status update one</strong>

Hi Rach and Harrison,

I am still working on the first feature of my terminal app - where users can search for specific hikes using the headings of my CSV file. I have used the tty-prompt gem for users to select how they would like to search by. At the moment users can search for hikes by the name of hikes. I want to implement a search function where they can search using distance of hike, distance from Melbourne, and whether the hikes are wheelchair or dog friendly. 

I am hoping to get onto the feature where users can input their own hikes and will utilise the geocoder gem for the distance from Melbourne.

Kind regards,

Michelle


<strong>5/9/19 Status update two</strong>

Hi Rach and Harrison,

I have mostly finished my terminal app. Yesterday, I finished working on my search function - so users can now search hikes by the name of the hike, distance of the hike, distance from Melbourne, the place of the hike, whether the hikes are wheelchair friendly or dog friendly. 

For the next part of my app, where the user has the ability to add hikes through a series of questions I encountered some challenges. One challenge was that I thought I could use the geocoder gem to calculate the distance from Melbourne. Unfortunately, I hadn't read the documentation properly and this feature (distance between objects) is only available for Rails. As a result, I just had to get users to input this themselves. 

Kind regards,

Michelle
