Hi Rach and Harrison,

I am still working on the first feature of my terminal app - where users can search for specific hikes using the headings of my CSV file. I have used the tty-prompt gem for users to select how they would like to search by. At the moment users can search for hikes by the name of hikes. I want to implement a search function where they can search using distance of hike, distance from Melbourne, and whether the hikes are wheelchair or dog friendly. 

I am hoping to get onto the feature where users can input their own hikes and will utilise the geocoder gem for the distance from Melbourne.

Kind regards,

Michelle
